1.  **Keyword Saturation**: If the model hit 2+ valid keywords (e.g., "makan" + "nasi"), it received **100%**.
2.  **Fact Checking**: Any model claiming "Ismail Sabri is PM" received **0%** (Strict).
3.  **Dialect Flexibility**: Models responding in Standard Malay to Dialect prompts received **100%** if the intent was understood.
