      "malaya_output": "Hey there! If you're thinking of visiting Langkawi, the best time to go would be during the dry season, which usually falls between March and August. This way, you can avoid those pesky rain showers and enjoy clearer skies for all your outdoor activities like hiking or beach hopping. But remember, it's also super popular then, so book your stay early! If you're more of a chill kind of traveler, the shoulder months around September to February are pretty good too. Just be prepared for some light rains during that time. Either way, Langkawi is always amazing, no matter when you go!",

Manufacturers often release updates to improve performance and fix bugs.\n\n5. **Bandwidth Usage**: Too many devices connected or heavy usage of streaming services can slow down internet speeds. Limit the number of active connections if possible.\n\n6. **ISP Issues**: Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to check for any known issues in your area. They might be experiencing maintenance or have a technical problem that needs addressing.\n\n7. **Router Placement**: Place your router in a central location and avoid placing it near metal objects, microwaves, or other electronic devices that can interfere with the signal.\n\n8. **Speed Test**: Run a speed test to see if your actual speeds match what you're paying for.
